# Movie_Recommendation_Engine
Using cosine similarity i have built a content based Movie Recommender system.
The goal behind content-based filtering is to classify products with specific keywords, learn what the customer likes, look up those terms in the database, and then recommend similar things.
This type of recommender system is hugely dependent on the inputs provided by users.
